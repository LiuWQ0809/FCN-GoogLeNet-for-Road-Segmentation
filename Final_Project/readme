Run incptn_fcn_heatmap.py to see heat map.

Run incptn_fcn_kitti.py to train with kitty dataset or incptn_fcn_bdd.py to train with bad dataset

Setting variables in the code:

SAVER_NAME = '16x16x16'		# define the kernel size of fcn model
RESTORE_VAR = True			# restore save variables from last training		
SAVE_VAR = False				# save training results this time
TRAIN = False				# whether or not to train the model
TRAIN_DIV = 1				# divide the training set into # part 

RUN = True					# run the test or not

TEST_ALL = False				# use test dataset or Images folder instead
